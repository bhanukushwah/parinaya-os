- Status: Defining requirements
- Last activity: 2026-02-13 — Milestone v1.0 started

## Accumulated Context

- Milestone initialized: `v1.0` — **Core Wedding OS** (focus: Core v1 OS).
- Product direction remains WhatsApp-first wedding coordination with Parent Admin + Family Coordinator operator model.
- Active scope centers on events, guest model/import/dedupe, WhatsApp invites + RSVP, parent dashboard/exports, website/gifts, and roles/audit.
- Key blocker: `REQUIREMENTS.md` and `ROADMAP.md` are not yet created, so phased execution cannot begin.
